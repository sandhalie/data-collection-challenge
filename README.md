## Background
An exciting opportunity is presented in this project to learn web scraping and data analysis techniques. Skills will be gained in identifying HTML elements, extracting data using tools like Splinter and Beautiful Soup, and analyzing and visualizing the collected information. Various data types, including tables and recurring elements, will be scraped throughout the project. By participating, core data-related skills applicable to future projects will be strengthened.
